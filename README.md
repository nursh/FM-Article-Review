## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Anchor positioning
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt about anchor positioning for the social-media popup


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Anchor positioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNXEORSk4GU&t=617s) - This helped me with the positioning of the social media toast / popup. It gave me a good starting point and introduced me to a new concept in CSS.
